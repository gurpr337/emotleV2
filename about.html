        <h2>About Emotle</h2>
        <div style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 20px; color: #b0b0b0;">
            <p>Emotle is a daily word-guessing game with a twist: instead of just guessing a word, you're translating a story told through emojis.</p>
            
            <p>Inspired by the simplicity of Wordle and the expressive power of emojis, Emotle challenges players to think creatively and symbolically. Every day, a new "emoji phrase" is selected, and players have five attempts to guess the hidden word or phrase it represents.</p>
            
            <p>Our mission is to provide a quick, fun, and mentally stimulating break in your day. Whether you're an emoji expert or just looking for a new puzzle, Emotle is designed for everyone.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">How it started</h3>
            <p>Emotle began as a side project to explore how much meaning we can pack into a few tiny icons. It quickly grew into a daily ritual for a community of puzzle lovers worldwide.</p>
