        <div style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 20px; color: #d0d0d0;">
            <p>Emotle is a daily word-guessing game with a creative twist: instead of just guessing a word based on its letters, you're translating a story told through emojis. It's a test of lateral thinking, symbolic interpretation, and vocabulary.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">The Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Inspired by the global phenomenon of Wordle and the incredibly expressive power of the modern emoji alphabet, Emotle was born from a simple question: <em>"Can you tell a story with just three icons?"</em> It turns out, you can—and it's a lot of fun to solve. Emojis have become a universal language, and Emotle challenges you to master that language in a playful, competitive environment.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">How it Works</h3>
            <p>Every day at midnight, a new puzzle is released. Our team (and sometimes our community!) selects a phrase, object, or concept and maps it to a unique combination of emojis. Your job is to deduce the target word. Each guess gives you feedback: blue for a correct letter in the right spot, pink for a correct letter in the wrong spot, and grey for letters not in the word at all. It's a blend of logic and linguistic deduction.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">A Global Community</h3>
            <p>What started as a small side project has grown into a daily ritual for puzzle enthusiasts worldwide. Emotle is more than just a game; it's a shared experience. We love seeing how different cultures interpret the same set of emojis. Whether you're playing on your morning commute or challenging your friends in a group chat, you're part of a global community of "Emotlers."</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">Our Commitment</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a quick, fun, and mentally stimulating break in your day. We are committed to keeping Emotle free, accessible, and inclusive. We constantly refine our emoji selection and game mechanics based on player feedback to ensure the best possible experience. We believe that games should be simple to learn but provide enough depth to keep you coming back day after day.</p>
