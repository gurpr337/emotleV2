            <p>Ready to take your Emotle game to the next level? Here are some advanced strategies used by top players to solve even the trickiest daily puzzles.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">1. Master the "Vowel Hunt"</h3>
            <p>Almost every Emotle answer contains at least one vowel (A, E, I, O, U). A common strategy is to use your first one or two guesses to "fish" for vowels. Words like <em>ADIEU</em>, <em>AUDIO</em>, or <em>OUNCE</em> are popular starters because they cover 3-4 vowels in a single go.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">2. The "Letter Frequency" Benefit</h3>
            <p>In the English language, certain letters appear much more frequently than others. After vowels, focus on high-frequency consonants like <strong>E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, </strong> and <strong>D</strong>. Avoiding "expensive" letters like Q, X, J, and Z until you have a solid lead can save precious attempts.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">3. Compound Emoji Logic</h3>
            <p>Don't just look at emojis individually. Look at how they interact. A ❄️ followed by a 🏠 might mean "IGLOO", but a ❄️ followed by a 🏃 might mean "SKIING" or "SLIDE". The sequence often describes a process or a specific attribute of the hidden word.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">4. Think Outside the Box</h3>
            <p>Some puzzles use emojis for their phonetic sound rather than their meaning. While rare in the daily puzzle, keep an eye out for "rebus" style clues. For example, an 👁️ followed by a ❤️ might literally mean "I LOVE".</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">5. Use the Process of Elimination</h3>
            <p>As you guess, the on-screen keyboard updates its colors. Use this as a map. If you know the word starts with "S" and ends with "E", but "T" and "A" are greyed out, you've significantly narrowed down the possibilities. Don't waste a guess on a word containing letters you already know are absent.</p>
