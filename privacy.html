        <div style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 20px; color: #d0d0d0;">
            <p>At Emotle, we are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our visitors. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, protect, and use your information when you play our daily word games.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">1. Data Storage & Local Persistence</h3>
            <p>The primary way Emotle functions is through your browser's "Local Storage" technology. Your game progress, historical statistics, win rates, and daily streaks are saved locally on your device. We do not have a central database that stores this personal gameplay data. This means your achievements stay with you, but it also means that clearing your browser cache or switching devices will reset your statistics.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">2. Advertising & Personalized Content</h3>
            <p>To keep Emotle free for everyone, we partner with third-party advertising networks, primarily Google AdSense. These partners may use cookies and web beacons in their ads to collect non-personally identifiable information (such as your IP address, your ISP, and the browser you used to visit our site). This information is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.</p>
            <p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">3. Analytics & Usage Tracking</h3>
            <p>We use basic, anonymized analytics services to monitor aggregate traffic patterns. This helps us understand which puzzles are the most popular and identify any technical issues that might be affecting the game's performance. We do not track individual users or correlate your gameplay with any personally identifiable information.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">4. Children's Information</h3>
            <p>Emotle does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">5. Consent</h3>
            <p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. This policy was last updated on January 2nd, 2026.</p>
