            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">What is Emotle?</h3>
            <p>Emotle is a daily word puzzle where you translate a series of emojis into a specific word or phrase. Think of it as a rebus puzzle for the mobile era!</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">When is a new Emotle released?</h3>
            <p>A fresh puzzle is available every day at midnight based on your local time zone. If you've finished today's, check back tomorrow!</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Why did my streak reset?</h3>
            <p>Streaks and game history are stored locally in your browser's "Local Storage." This means if you clear your browser data, use "Incognito" or "Private" mode, or switch to a different device or browser, your progress won't follow you. We recommend playing on the same device and browser to keep your streak alive.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Are the answers always single words?</h3>
            <p>For now, yes. Most daily puzzles are single words of varying lengths. However, we're exploring multi-word phrases for special events and future updates!</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Can I play past puzzles?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! You can visit the <a href="archive.html" style="color: #00aaff;">Archive</a> to see previous daily puzzles or jump into <a href="practice.html" style="color: #00aaff;">Practice Mode</a> to sharpen your emoji-decoding skills with random challenges.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">How is the "Daily Phrase" chosen?</h3>
            <p>Our team meticulously selects phrases that are common enough to be guessable but tricky enough to be a challenge. We look for emojis that have distinct meanings but can also work together to tell a subtle story.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Can I suggest an emoji phrase?</h3>
            <p>Yes! We love community input. Visit our <a href="submit-phrase.html" style="color: #00aaff;">Submit a Phrase</a> page to send us your creative ideas. If we use your idea, we might even give you a shoutout!</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Is there a mobile app?</h3>
            <p>Currently, Emotle is a Progressive Web App (PWA). You can "Add to Home Screen" on both iOS and Android for an app-like experience without needing to visit an app store.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">How do the colors work?</h3>
            <p>After each guess, the tile colors shift: Blue means the letter is correct and in the right spot. Pink means the letter is in the word but in a different spot. Grey means the letter isn't in the word at all.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Is Emotle free to play?</h3>
            <p>Yes, Emotle is completely free and supported by a small number of non-intrusive ads. Our goal is to keep the game accessible to everyone.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 20px;">Why can't I type with my keyboard?</h3>
            <p>Emotle supports both the on-screen keyboard and physical keyboard input. If your physical keyboard isn't responding, try clicking inside the game area once to ensure the game has "focus."</p>
