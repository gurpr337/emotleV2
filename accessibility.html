            <p>At Emotle, we believe that the joy of daily puzzles should be accessible to everyone. We are committed to making our website and gameplay experience inclusive and usable for all people, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">Our Ongoing Efforts</h3>
            <p>We are continuously working to improve the accessibility of our site to ensure that it meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We understand that many of our puzzles rely on visual icons (emojis), and we are actively exploring ways to make these clues accessible to those with visual impairments.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Emotle is designed to be fully navigable via keyboard. You can use the physical keyboard to type your guesses, the 'Enter' key to submit, and 'Backspace' to edit. We also ensure that all interactive elements on the page have clear focus states for users navigating via keyboards or other assistive devices.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">Visual Constraints & Screen Readers</h3>
            <p>We use semantic HTML5 elements to provide structure to our pages. While we are proud of our high-contrast dark mode, we recognize that our emoji-based puzzles present unique challenges for screen reader users. We are currently implementing descriptive "Alt-Text" for our emoji phrases to provide a text-based alternative for our visual clues.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">Browser Support</h3>
            <p>Emotle is built using modern web standards. For the best experience, we recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. These browsers provide the best built-in support for assistive technologies.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 25px;">Feedback & Assistance</h3>
